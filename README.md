# Squadron 65 - Binds for 65% Keebs

This is my personal CFG/binds for using a 65% keyboard and mouse with 4 side buttons.

Most binds are left as default, with a few changes to make it easier for those with non-standard layouts (specifically 65% users).

Changes are listed as follows:
  
  ## Camera (see below for exact binds/breakdown)
    `Z` - Third Person (Default is F4)
    `F4` - Freelook (Default is Z)

  ## Flight - Power Triangle Management
    `Mouse Button 5` Weapon Power (Tap to +, Hold to Max)
    `Mouse Button 4` Shield Power (Tap to +, Hold to Max)
    `F8` Engine Power (Tap to +, Hold to Max)
    `F5` Reset Power
  
  All commands associated with the Advanced Camera Controls will be swapped to Z, as to make it easier to save camera angles and change Settings. Advanced Camera Controls are as follows:

  ## Advanced Camera Controls
    `Z + ,` Hold to Save Camera 1 // Tap to Load Camera 1
    `Z + .` Hold to Save Camera 2 // Tap to Load Camera 2
    `Z + /` Hold to Save Camera 3 // Tap to Load Camera 3
    `Z + ;` Hold to Save Camera 4 // Tap to Load Camera 4
    `Z + '` Hold to Save Camera 5 // Tap to Load Camera 5
    `Z + Home`
    `Z + -(Minus)` Decrease DoF
    `Z + =(Equals)` Increase DoF
    `Z + UpArrow` Camera Pan Y axis (Forward)
    `Z + DownArrow` Camera Pan Y axis (Backward)
    `Z + LeftArrow` Camera Pan X axis (Left)
    `Z + RightArrow` Camera Pan X axis (Right)
    `Z + PgUp` Camera Pan Z axis (Up)
    `Z + PgDn` Camera Pan Z axis (Down)
    `Z + Del` Reset Camera Position

Current as of LIVE 3.22.
