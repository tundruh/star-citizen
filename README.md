# Squadron 65 - Explore the `Verse with Non-Standard Keyboards

This is my personal CFG/binds for using a 65% keyboard and mouse with 4 side buttons.

Most binds are left as default, with a few changes to make it easier for those with non-standard layouts). Of course, binds will still work on any keyboard regardless of form factor, just be sure to check your boards manual/key locations for anything smaller than 65%.

## How to Import Binds/CFG using SC Launch Configurator
1. Download and install [SC Launch Configurator](https://www.luftwerft.com/)
2. Download the ".profiles" file in the repo
3. Open SC Launch Configurator
4. Navigate to "Profile" and click "Import" at the bottom
5. Import ".profiles" from repo
6. Highlight profile and click "LIVE" button to the right (will install to latest LIVE SC folder)
7. Launch SC

If you choose to change binds/settings in game, feel free to update and backup your new profile in the SC Launch Configurator.
