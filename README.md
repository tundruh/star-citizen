# Squadron 65 - Explore the `Verse with Non-Standard Keyboards

This is my personal CFG/binds for using a 65% keyboard and mouse with 4 side buttons.

Most binds are left as default, with a few changes to make it easier for those with non-standard layouts). Of course, binds will still work on any keyboard regardless of form factor, just be sure to check your boards manual/key locations for anything smaller than 65%.

## How to Import Binds/CFG using SC Launch Configurator

  1. Download and install [SC Launch Configurator](https://www.luftwerft.com/), and save `Sq65 Binds.profiles`
  2. Open SC Launch Configurator
  3. Launch SC, adjust any settings you prefer first (Graphics, Audio, Interface, etc.), apply and close to generate your profile
  4. In SC Launch Configurator, go to "Profile"
  5. **BACKUP YOUR OWN PROFILE FIRST** by clicking "Export" (Launching SC first ensures a profile is available)
  6. Click "Import", and import the updated `Sq65 Binds.profiles` from repo
  7. Highlight `Sq65 Binds.profiles` in SC Launch Configurator and click "LIVE" button to the right
  8. Play SC

If you choose to change binds/settings in game, feel free to update and backup your new profile in the SC Launch Configurator.

**This profile is specific to my CFG/build, as I play on UW QHD. You may run the game with different settings in other menus (i.e General, Audio, Graphics, etc). Please back up your own settings before importing mine (see step 6 above). If your game does not launch due to errors in rendering/resolution, review your graphics settings either in game or in the SC Launch Configurator.**
